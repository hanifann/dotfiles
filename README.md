This is a repository dedicated to back-up and share my dotfiles when needed.

<h6>Introduction</h6><hr>
A collection of configs to be placed in the users home directory usually prefixed with a period, hence the name dotfiles. This repo is actually intended for my personal backup, but everyone are welcome to use these resources. Maybe not always up to date with my current setup. I also put some explanations in this README file, because people say they are interested with my setup. I hope this will be useful. Also, please read what written inside the files before use. And remember, copying configuration file doesn't make it instantly work
